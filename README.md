# MultiDelete
Let's be honest here, using the mouse or the shift key to try to select multiple items for deleting at once is not so reliable
so let's ditch the shift key, let's use this program to delete multiple files at once without too many procedures.
All you need to do is input the name of the file and they'll be gone within seconds, no lag, nothing.
(Good for deleting millions of multiple created files)
